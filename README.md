# General Information
This project aims to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.
Background: Bike-sharing systems allow individuals to borrow bikes on a short-term basis, providing a convenient mode of transportation.
Business Problem: BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company seeks to understand the factors affecting bike demand to strategize and recover post-pandemic.
Dataset: The dataset includes daily bike demand data along with various factors such as weather conditions, seasons, and user types. It provides a comprehensive view of how these variables influence bike demand.
# Conclusions
The year (indicating an upward trend in bike demand from 2018 to 2019) significantly impacts bike demand.
Weather conditions (clear weather leads to higher demand) are crucial in predicting bike rentals.
Seasonal variations affect bike demand, with summer and fall showing higher rentals compared to spring and winter.
Registered users contribute more consistently to bike rentals compared to casual users.
# Technologies Used
pandas - version 1.2.4
numpy - version 1.20.3
scikit-learn - version 0.24.2
matplotlib - version 3.4.2
seaborn - version 0.11.1
